					<description><![CDATA[<h4>Description Title</h4>

Cleaning your bathroom probably isn’t at the top of your weekend-fun list, that's why Method developed a tub and tile cleaner that does the heavy lifting for you. The plant-based formula with new Powergreen technology dissolves soap scum and pesky stains, so you do less scrubbing. Less scrubbing = more time for fun. Powergreen technology is cutting-edge green chemistry that harnesses the strength of naturally derived, non-toxic ingredients to deliver a mighty cleaning punch. So even after you’ve left the shower, lactic acid and corn-starch derived decyl glucoside are busy dissolving and preventing soap scum and lime deposits.
