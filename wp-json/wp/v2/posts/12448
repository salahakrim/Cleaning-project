The poll, conducted by Global Strategy Group, reveals that public opinion is clear: the flexible economy is good for workers, good for consumers and good for New York.<\/p>\n<p>The poll also found that New Yorkers believe that the positive contributions of flexible economy businesses should be recognized, with a majority of respondents wanting the state government to focus on\u00a0<em>growing<\/em>\u00a0technology jobs. An overwhelming number of voters (88%) believe the government should focus on growing and supporting New York based technology companies, like Clany.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only are platforms like ours creating new ways for consumers to obtain the services they need, they\u2019re creating new opportunities for people to supply these services and to make money,\u201d said\u00a0the Co-Founder and CEO of Clany. \u201cIt is clear the public sees the value in growing technology jobs and supporting flexible economy platforms, the government should follow this lead. Technology is not a great disruptor; it is a great creator.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>He<\/strong>\u00a0continued, \u201cThe way people work today is different, with millions of Americans wanting the flexibility to design their own careers or job choices. Platforms like Clany are an important \u2013 and growing \u2013 part of giving workers access to the flexibility they need. This isn\u2019t the \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2013 it\u2019s the flexible economy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>He<\/strong>\u00a0concluded, \u201cThe flexible economy needs a new, flexible approach to providing workers with the benefits they need. That\u2019s why we are calling the development of a portable benefits vehicle that would provide New York\u2019s flexible economy workers with the opportunity to access worker protections and benefits.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first thing a person sees before they enter the building are the windows.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"aside","meta":[],"categories":[605],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12448"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12448"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12448\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12448"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12448"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12448"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
