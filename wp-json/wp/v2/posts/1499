We also waste a great deal more time on them than we have to.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a few time-saving tips that\u2019ll help you reclaim your free time, courtesy of Clany!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Be More Efficient<\/h3>\n<p>A lack of efficiency \u2013 either through an eclectic personality, an easily-distracted mind or simple laziness \u2013 is one of the primary reasons that cleaning the house can take hours. In all but the most extreme cases, if you spend hours cleaning up a room, you probably weren\u2019t really cleaning the whole time. Instead, you were trying to do about ten different things at once.<\/p>\n<p>Clany Tip: Don\u2019t try to take on more than one chore at a time. Focus on what you\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Do Away With Procrastination<\/h3>\n<p>As far as chores are concerned, procrastination is your worst nightmare. The longer you let a mess pile up, the more difficult it\u2019ll become to clean. What may once have been a ten-minute weekly job can thus very easily turn into an hours-long slog through filth and trash.<\/p>\n<p>Clany Tip: Don\u2019t work in bursts \u2013 make a regular effort to keep your surroundings clean.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Tone Down The Clutter<\/h3>\n<p>Clutter is awful \u2013 and the more there is, the less happy you\u2019re going to be with your surroundings. A cluttered room not only has a negative effect on your mental well-being, it\u2019s also extremely rough to clean. Consider whether or not there\u2019s any junk in your surroundings you can be rid of \u2013 then get rid of it.<\/p>\n<p>Clany Tip: Don\u2019t just keep your surroundings clean \u2013 keep them tidy, too. The less clutter you\u2019ve got, the easier it\u2019ll be to keep your home looking spotless.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Don\u2019t Try To Do Everything On Your Own<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re living on your own, housework shouldn\u2019t be a one-person job. Although we\u2019d strongly advise against micromanagement (seriously. Don\u2019t do it. Just don\u2019t), there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking (or encouraging) your family members or roommates to lend you a hand. After all, they have to live there same as you \u2013 you should both be making an effort to keep the place tidy.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Plan Things Out.<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to motivate yourself to keep things clean is to set up a schedule. Have a day and time on which you\u2019ll clean the bathroom, or reorganize your clothes, or vacuum, or go pick up groceries. Don\u2019t deviate from that time unless you absolutely have to.<\/p>\n<p>Clany Tip: Your schedule doesn\u2019t need to chart out your every waking minute. Just set aside a specific time to do your chores, and you\u2019ll be fine.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Change How You Look At Cleaning<\/h3>\n<p>Alright, this last one is admittedly a bit of a crazy statement, but maybe you spend too much time cleaning \u2013 and too much time putting it off \u2013 because you\u2019ve got the wrong perspective? Why not, as Babauta suggests, try turning it into a meditative exercise? You probably still won\u2019t enjoy doing chores, but at least you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re doing something else with yourself instead of just sweeping or scrubbing a toilet.<\/p>\n<p>Clany Tip: Try thinking about a creative pursuit while cleaning \u2013 writing, art, or music, for example.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>End of tenancy cleaning is our only domestic-focused service and is available to tenants, landlords and letting agents.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":15877,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[18],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/photo-18.jpg","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1499"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1499"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1499\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/15877"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1499"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1499"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/clany.vamtam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1499"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
